<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I was in year 10. It was compulsory for students to pick a certain amount of electives for this year and "Computing" was one of the options. My friends and I thought that there was nothing else better to pick so we chose computing on a whim. I ended up enjoying the elective more that I had imagined but since the school's resources were limited, I was not able to go much further than very simple programming and game design. Unfortunately, when I moved on to VCE, there weren't any technology-related subjects that I was able to choose from so I had to just leave everything IT related behind for a while. When it was time to pick my preferences for university, I researched mainly IT and business related courses but ended up settling with IT since I recall enjoying it more than business.</p>
  <p> I chose to study Information Technology at RMIT because of an excursion that the computing elective had. It was a week-long excursion that students from my school and other schools attended. The main goal of this excursion was to create a very basic web page (similar to this one but worse) with basic information of each of the group members and present it in front of the students of the other schools. Each group was assigned a volunteer and these volunteers showed us around some of the different buildings that RMIT had in the city. The only other university that my school had excursions to was Deakin but those ones were more general tours whereas the RMIT one was to complete a project. I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of RMIT and was somewhat more familiar with it then the other universities so I decided to choose it as my first preference.</p>
  <p>During my time studying the Information Technology course at RMIT, I mainly expect to acquire the skills and gain the experience necessary to find a job which may require the things that I learnt from RMIT. I also expect to learn the importance of working as a group and collaborating with others and most of the assignments that were completed in high school were mainly tasks that had to be done alone such as SACs in test conditions and exams. Some of the classes in IT, mainly introduction to information technology and user-centred design, require the completion of projects within groups so I would like to acquire skills relating to communication and teamwork whilst working on these assignments.</p>
